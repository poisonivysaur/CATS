# CATS
Children Assistant to Tell Stories (CATS). A cute companion to tell bed time stories to kids.

## Inspiration
I got the idea of a storytelling companion from one of my undergraduate colleague's thesis which discusses about a chat bot that tells stories to children and at the same time learns and converses with them. Although my submission is only an effect that reads a story based on a simple user interaction and not an actual chat bot (e.g. Google Home), I am inspired with the interactive possibilities that AR can bring in the future.

## What it does
The cute cat reads to you the Hare and the Tortoise story (shortened cut audio clip for demo purposes) when a user taps "Play Story." The cute cat can also meow when you pet it!

## How I built it
I built the effect using Spark AR Studio v.83 and I also came across the segmentation and camera texture tutorial in the Spark AR Learning Center, and I thought it would make a great background on top of my effect to induce a cozy environment for story telling. I followed through the tutorial while tweaking some minor customizations for my effect.

## Challenges I ran into
One of the challenges I ran into was finding a suitable audio clip in the right format. Of course majority of the story audio clips I found was in the .mp3 format, and I tried to convert them to the required .m4a format for Spark online; however, the converted .m4a file still cannot be imported into Spark. What worked for me was I had to use a 3rd party software Audacity to manually edit the audio clip (e.g. splitting to mono, adjusting the bit format and Hz rate, etc.) into a correct .m4a format.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
For a month since the submission dates opened, I was completely out of ideas. After trying out some tutorials, it made me think "what makes AR different from another 2D animating sticker lens" of having an augmented sense it enables the user to have a more interactive experience

## What I learned

## What's next for Children Assistant to Tell Stories (CATS)
I envision that in the future AR models can be interactive chat bots as well-- being able to learn speech input and in turn converse with users. For CATS, it could be the next favorite children story companion :)

All this wouldn't be possible with leandrodreamer's (https://sketchfab.com/leandrodreamer) cute cat model (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cat-cute-5af376ba056040fd82e389b4b030e084) and Storynory children audio clips!!!
